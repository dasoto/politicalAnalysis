Currently working online on: https://ancient-everglades-66215.herokuapp.com/politicAnalyzer

This project analyze the votes of Senators or House of Representatives and create the number of clusters specified using K-Mean algorithm. The idea is to identify sub-groups beyond of the typical division of democrats and republicans based on the way they vote for each bill.
The picture represent the clusters obtained and the size of the bubble is according to the number of twitter followers (updated on July 2017). Currently is working with offline csv data, but the real version is obtaining data from Twitter API and Propublica Congress API: https://www.propublica.org/datastore/api/propublica-congress-api
